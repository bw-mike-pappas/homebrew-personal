Homebrew-personal
=================
This repository contains my personal [Homebrew][home] formulae.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap indrajitr/personal` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can do
`brew install indrajitr/personal/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/indrajitr-personal/master/<formula>.rb
```

Docs
----
`brew help`, `man brew`, or the [Homebrew wiki][wiki].
