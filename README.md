=================
This repository contains [Homebrew][home] formulae that are needed for the setupScript.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap bw-mike-pappas/setupScript` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can do
`brew install bw-mike-pappas/setupScript/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/bw-mike-pappas-setupScript/master/<formula>.rb
```
